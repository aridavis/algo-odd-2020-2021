# Greatest Common Divisor

## Introduction

In mathematics, the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two or more integers, which are not all zero, is the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers. For two integers x, y, the greatest common divisor of x and y is denoted **_$gcd(x,y)$_** . For example, the gcd of 8 and 12 is 4, that is, **_$gcd(8,12)=4$_**.

## Input

The input will start with **_$t$_** determining the total test cases. Each $t$ lines, there will be $n$. The next line, the program will receive input for $n$ times (**_k\_{1..n}_**)

## Output

For each **_t_** lines, print the GCD and dont forget to print Case #$i$: before the GCD

## Test Case

Input:

<pre>
3
5 
2 4 6 8 10
3
1 2 3
1
23
</pre>

Output:

<pre>
Case #1: 2
Case #2: 1
Case #3: 23
</pre>
