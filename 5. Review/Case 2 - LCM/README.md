# Least Common Multiple

## Introduction

In arithmetic and number theory, the least common multiple, lowest common multiple, or smallest common multiple of two integers a and b, usually denoted by **_lcm(a, b)_**, is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both a and b. Source [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor)

## Input

The input will start with **_$t$_** determining the total test cases. Each **_t_** lines, there will be **_n_**. The next line, the program will receive input for **_n_** times (**_k\_{1..n}_**)

## Output

For each **_t_** lines, print the LCM and dont forget to print Case #**_i_**: before the LCM

## Test Case

Input:

<pre>
3
5 
2 4 6 8 10
3
1 2 3
1
23
</pre>

Output:

<pre>
Case #1: 10
Case #2: 6
Case #3: 23
</pre>
