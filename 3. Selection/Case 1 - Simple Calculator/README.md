# Simple Calculator

## Introduction

Today, Tutu is so bored and he wants to make a simple calculator which can add, minus, divide, multiply and modulus. Unfortunately, he doesn't know how to code, and he asks you to make it for him.

## Input
The input will be *X* which is the first number, *Operator* as the operator and *y* as the second number.

## Output
The output will be 2 lines, and you can see it below

## Test Case
| Input   | Output                               |
| ------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 10 + 50 | 10 + 50 = 60<br>10 plus 50 is 60     |
| 10 - 50 | 10 - 50 = -40<br>10 minus 50 is -40  |
| 10 * 50 | 10 * 50 = 500<br>10 times 50 is 500  |
| 10 / 50 | 10 / 50 = 0<br>10 divided by 50 is 0 |
| 10 % 50 | 10 % 50 = 10<br>10 modulus 50 is 10  |
