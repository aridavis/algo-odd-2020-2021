# String Sorting

## Introduction

As you have learnt about sorting, you are asked to sort strings in decending order

## Input

The input will be some several lines until it is EOF (end of file). To read input until EOF, you can use this code below

```
while(scanf("%[^\n]", strVariable) != EOF)
```

## Output

You must sort the input given

## Test Case

Input

<pre>
mawar
lukas
halo
hai
davis
binus
ari
</pre>

Output

<pre>
mawar
lukas
halo
hai
davis
binus
ari
</pre>

## How to Test

1. Create an input file called "input.txt" (whatever you like) and write all the inputs
2. Compile your codes (it will build an _exe_ file)
3. Run Command Prompt / Terminal and go to your project directory
4. Then type "caseFile.exe < input.txt > output.txt"
5. Open your output.txt to find if your answer is correct or not
