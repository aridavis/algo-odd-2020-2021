# Prime Numbers

## Introduction
One day, Tata told Tutu a story about prime number and we don't know what Tata told him. A few days later, Tutu told you the story but you understand nothing. At school, Tutu has learnt about prime numbers between 1 and 100 (I believe, you had learnt it before at elementary school). But Tutu wants to know more prime numbers. Instead of calculate in on paper, it is better for you to make a program to know the prime numbers between 2 numbers.

## Inputs
The input will be *t* as the test case numbers and followed by *t* lines which require 2 inputs which are *a* as the start number and *b* as the end number

## Outputs
Output all prime numbers between *a* and *b* in a line, but avoid a trailing space

## Constraint
1 <= *t* <= 1000<br>
1 <= *a* <= 10000<br>
a <= *b* <= 10000<br>

## Test Case
| Input                 | Output                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 2<br>1 10<br>5 10<br> | Case #1: 2 3 5 7<br>Case #2: 5 7<br> |
